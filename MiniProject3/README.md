# Regression
Linear and quadratic regression using least square problem
This project is implemented with Pandas, NumPy, and Matplotlib libraries
## How it works
Enter a CSV file address\
This code will read the whole file except the 10 data at the end\
Then suggests a linear or quadratic equation that fits the best \
Finally, it estimates the 10 remaining data and prints their errors, and draws the estimated equation
